# 1.2.0

Issues #3 and #4 were closed by users, but it still needed to be taken care of.

Main features: now accepts an option object as parameter. Now possible to pass 'expiration' and 'name' params to imgBB API.

Also, the way the tests worked was horribly wrong (was always uploading the same file, but imgBB API, by comparing checksum or something, is able to tell you're uploading the exact same file, thwarting the very purpose of the tests).

Fixed by making each test generate a random image, enabling proper testing for the new option object & easier developments from now on.

# 1.1.0

Module overhaul:  
Seeing some people found this module useful made me glad, so I decided to give it some love.

- Becomes dependency-free  
  The respectable `request` module was the only external dependency, but now that's unsupported, as `npm install` spams everytime, it's problematic.  
  While I could have replaced it with Axios, I preferred reinventing that wheel using standard node `https`. It should hold for the years to come.

- TypeScript support  
  TypeScript is all the rage and I'm still in the process of learning it. That's why I thought it was interesting to make this module TS compatible, **without breaking compatibility** for the `require();` users.

- Better integration for VSCode  
  I've discovered JSDoc since then. It should benefit even non-TypeScript users.

- Change code style
  I have semi colons everywhere except in this little module. Fixed that. Long live semi colons :)

- Upgraded file architecture & CI  
  [This is the resource](https://itnext.io/step-by-step-building-and-publishing-an-npm-typescript-package-44fe7164964c) that guided me through the TS/Jest stack, it was an interesting adventure.  
  I made my best to ensure this update won't break anything for you, but if it is the case, please open an issue :)

Todo:  
Write more in CONTRIBUTING.md so this module remains easy to fork & tweak. It may look more bloated than before, but I'm convinced decent documentation should fix it.

Making .mjs import work. Hopefully soon  
Supporting browsers (afterall why not)  
Supporting passing filename parameter  
Supporting arrays (in the very bottom of the list tbh)
